<h1>It's the foundation for patient-<br>
  centered primary care.</h1>
<p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,<br>
  staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more productive, less<br>
  stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.
</p>



<h2>It puts care at your command</h2>
<p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or <br>
  bounce around five windows to discover the last blood <br>
  count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your <br>
  note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas <br>
  learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every <br>
  patient you see.

<p>"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance <br>
  dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. <br>
  The right information is presented in the right way at the right time, <br>
  and the product leverages technology to actually improve the <br>
  quality of care I provide."
</p>
<p>&mdash; Dr. Steve Magee, Family Physician</p>



<h2>It brings your population to life</h2>
<p>Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across <br>
  your entire patient panel, so you know who needs extra <br>
  help and how best to give it to them. Easily reach out to <br>
  any subgroup of your population with proactive <br>
  interventions, and take comfort knowing you're a step <br>
  ahead.

<p>"Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a test in <br>
  the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe <br>
  levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines? That <br>
  doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important <br>
  questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! <br>
  Canvas is light-years ahead."

<p>&mdash; Dr. Ninad Athale, Family Physician</p>



<h2>It automates performance <br>
  improvement
</h2>
<p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you <br>
  understand performance, but they aren't enough to <br>
  improve quality and increase revenue day after day. <br>
  Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so <br>
  clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can <br>
  do.
</p>
<a>Learn more about practice management and billing.</a>
<p>"With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as <br>
  ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're <br>
  a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of <br>
  coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has <br>
  completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue <br>
  performance."
</p>
<p>&mdash; Dr. Sam Ward, Family Physician</p>
