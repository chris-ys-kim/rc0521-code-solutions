          <h1>It's the foundation for patient-<br>

          <p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,<br>
            staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more productive, less<br>
            stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

          <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or <br>
            bounce around five windows to discover the last blood <br>
            count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your <br>
            note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas <br>
            learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every <br>
            patient you see.

          <p>"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance <br>
            dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. <br>
            The right information is presented in the right way at the right time, <br>
            and the product leverages technology to actually improve the <br>
            quality of care I provide."

        <h2>It brings your population to life</h2>
        <p>Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across <br>
          your entire patient panel, so you know who needs extra <br>
          help and how best to give it to them. Easily reach out to <br>
          any subgroup of your population with proactive <br>
          interventions, and take comfort knowing you're a step <br>
          ahead.

          levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines? That <br>
          doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important <br>
          questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! <br>
          Canvas is light-years ahead."

          <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you <br>
            understand performance, but they aren't enough to <br>
            improve quality and increase revenue day after day. <br>
            Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so <br>
            clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can <br>
            do.

          <p>"With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as <br>
            ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're <br>
            a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of <br>
            coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has <br>
            completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue <br>
